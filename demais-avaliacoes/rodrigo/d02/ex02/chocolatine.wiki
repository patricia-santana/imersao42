Pain au chocolat (French: [pɛ̃ o ʃɔkɔla] ; lit. 'bread with chocolate'), also known as chocolatine (French: [ʃɔkɔlatin] ) in the south-west part of France and in French speaking parts of Canada, or couque au chocolat in Belgium, is a type of Viennoiserie pastry consisting of a cuboid-shaped piece of yeast-leavened laminated dough, similar in texture to a puff pastry, with one or two pieces of dark chocolate in the center. The chocolate usually has a slight bite to the texture.
Pain au chocolat is made of the same layered doughs as a croissant. Often sold still hot or warm from the oven, they are commonly sold alongside croissants in French bakeries and supermarkets.
